{"disclaimer":"Please be advised that over the course of American history, questions on the census have included some terminology that we consider outdated or even offensive today. We have attempted to include notes about the ways in which the views and language in federal documents have evolved and are continuing to evolve.","introPara":["The Census is an essential part of American democracy. The framers of the Constitution provided that the number of representatives in Congress from each state would be based on population. To apportion seats in Congress as equally as possible among the states, they envisioned a census to produce regular, accurate counts of the countryâ€™s population.","Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution established that an \"Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years,\" making the US the first country to conduct a regular periodical count of its people."],"methodologyNotes":["We have excluded the introductory questions used by Census takers to organize and track their work, such as the address, number in order of the houses they visited; age range to determine whether to ask questions for people over 14; or contact information for follow-up questions. We also excluded questions that are just references to supplemental schedules, such as those used for additional information on farms.","Once the Census began to serve statistical and policymaking objectives as well as apportionment requirements, additional schedules were administered to ask additional questions -- beyond what was covered by the population census -- on topics including manufacturing, agriculture, mortality, Native Americans, and veterans."]}
